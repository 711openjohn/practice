# Testcase Example:  '[3,2,3,null,3,null,1]'
#
# The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only
# one entrance to this area, called root.
#
# Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour,
# the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It
# will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were
# broken into on the same night.
#
# Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the
# thief can rob without alerting the police.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
# Output: 9
# Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4
#
#
#

    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# Definition for a binary tree node.


class Solution:
    memory = {}

    def rob(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        if root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return root.val
        if self.memory.get(root) is not None:
            return self.memory[root]
        # 偷父节点
        val1 = root.val
        if root.left:
            val1 += self.rob(root.left.left) + self.rob(root.left.right)
        if root.right:
            val1 += self.rob(root.right.left) + self.rob(root.right.right)
        # 不偷父节点
        val2 = self.rob(root.left) + self.rob(root.right)
        self.memory[root] = max(val1, val2)
