# Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent 
# elements. You may return the answer in any order. 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]
#  
#  Example 2: 
#  Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]
#  
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  1 <= nums.length <= 10⁵ 
#  -10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 10⁴ 
#  k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array]. 
#  It is guaranteed that the answer is unique. 
#  
# 
#  
#  Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), 
# where n is the array's size.
