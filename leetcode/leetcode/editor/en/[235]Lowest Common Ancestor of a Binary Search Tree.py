# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node 
# of two given nodes in the BST. 
# 
#  According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: ‚ÄúThe lowest common ancestor 
# is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p 
# and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).‚Äù 
# 
#  
#  Example 1: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
#  
# 
#  Example 2: 
#  
#  
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant 
# of itself according to the LCA definition.
#  
# 
#  Example 3: 
# 
#  
# Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
# Output: 2
#  
# 
#  
#  Constraints: 
# 
#  
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10‚Åµ]. 
#  -10‚Åπ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åπ 
#  All Node.val are unique. 
#  p != q 
#  p and q will exist in the BST.
